  <p>Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (listen) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ (listen) wik-ee-) is a multilingual free online
    encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers through open collaboration and a wiki-based editing
    system. Its editors are known as Wikipedians. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history.[3]
    It is consistently one of the 10 most popular websites ranked by the Similarweb and formerly Alexa; as of 2022,
    Wikipedia was ranked the 7th most popular site.[3][4][5] It is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American
    non-profit organization funded mainly through donations.[6]</p>
